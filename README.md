I don't mind leaving any of my design open source! I can send you a
link to my raw file and you and do with it what you want. I'll also send
over a few different file formats for posting on social media if that's
something you'd like to do.


As for recognition, I only ask that you credit me for the design. If
you'd like to make an announcement, adding my freelance website would
be peachy! http://iroh.co/
